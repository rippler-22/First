Hello! 

My name is Marc and I have a passion for continous learning, programming, and the blockchain.
I am a big Bitcoin & Ripple (XRP) supporter along with a few other cryptocurrencies. I would love to eventually become a developer for Ripple or any other crypto company. 

I am self-taught and fluent in HTML5 & CSS3. I am currently learning JavaScript & PHP to make my code more interactive as well as fully functional on the front and back end. I realize I am just getting started in this industry and atmosphere and the best way to adapt is to code every day and learn by doing. 

I am a sophomore in college and leaning towards majoring in CS or SE. I currently treat learning code as my full time job and I am lucky I am in the position to do so. I regret not getting started on coding sooner but I am glad I have found my passion already while still young.
